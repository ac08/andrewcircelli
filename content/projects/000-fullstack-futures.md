excerpt:
  Hey all! If you have read my blog, you are likely aware of one of my finer coding
  projects. And although there is still work to be done, I am happy to share my progress.
  fullStack futures is a new take on LinkedIn. No longer are you required to be a business
  professional to have a legitimate online presence. Use fullStack Futures as a central hub to maintain your, or your childâ€™s online profile; and to allow recruiters to contact you about opportunities in your select field.

### Use Case

Say you are an All-American high school athlete from a small town. You can use my futures
application to stack your achievements for university athletic or amaeutur-level coaches to
see. Or maybe you're a parent and see your young child excel in every subject at school. Use
the futures application to begin to build and track your child's achievements for university
administrators to see. Even, say you're interested in joining the US military out of high school,
you can use the futures application to display your accolades with recruiters from any of the
nation's top military branches.
