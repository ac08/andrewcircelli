And when it comes to software, APIs are literally everywhere. But first, what is an <strong>interface</strong>? Well in the software world, an interface is an endpoint of an application that an end-user can interact with. And so <strong>Programming Interface</strong>? That is simply the method by which different programs interact with each another. Whether that is to access an underlying data source, or to \"add specific functionality to an application, without having to write all of the code themselves\" - <strong>RapidAPI</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>APIs go hand in hand with one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science: abstraction. Abstraction is just a way of organizing the complexity of a system so that complicated actions can be handled in a simple way. <strong>infoworld</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you are aware, there are many types of API interactions and they serve many functions. And to make this interaction easier, protocols have been put in place.</p>\n<p>But if you are here, you know all about that. I want to use this post to illustrate <em>some</em> of the ways I implement these interfaces in my code.</p>\n<p>Table of Contents</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#HTTP-Methods-REST\">HTTP Methods used in REST APIs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Identify-Where-Your-State-Should-Live\">Identify Where Your State Should Live</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"HTTP-Methods-used-in-REST-APIs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#HTTP-Methods-used-in-REST-APIs\" aria-label=\"HTTP Methods used in REST APIs permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HTTP Methods used in REST APIs</h2>\n<p>REST APIs and their associated HTTP methods are universal.
